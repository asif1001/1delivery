# Git Conflict Resolution Guide

You have divergent branches that need to be reconciled. Here are the steps to resolve this:

## Option 1: Merge Strategy (Recommended)
```bash
git config pull.rebase false
git pull origin main --no-edit
git push origin main
```

## Option 2: Rebase Strategy (Clean History)
```bash
git config pull.rebase true
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

## Option 3: Force Push (Use with Caution)
If you want to overwrite the remote with your local changes:
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

## What Happened
- Your local branch has commits that aren't on the remote
- The remote branch has commits that aren't in your local branch
- Git needs to know how to combine these changes

## Recommended Solution
Run these commands in order:

```bash
git config pull.rebase false
git pull origin main --no-edit
```

If there are conflicts, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them. Then:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```
