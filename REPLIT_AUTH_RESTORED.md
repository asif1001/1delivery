# ðŸ”§ REPLIT AUTHENTICATION SETUP

## Current Issue:
Your OILDELIVERY app works perfectly in Replit, but Firebase authentication is blocking login attempts because the Replit domain isn't authorized.

## Your Replit App URL:
Based on your current setup, your app runs at:
- **Development**: `https://oil-delivery-tracking-app.asif1001.repl.co`
- **Live Deployment**: Will be `https://[your-app].replit.app`

## Firebase Console Fix Required:
You need to add your Replit domain to Firebase authorized domains:

### Step 1: Get Your Exact Replit URL
1. Your current Replit URL appears to be: `oil-delivery-tracking-app.asif1001.repl.co`
2. For live deployment, it will be different

### Step 2: Add to Firebase Console
Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/oil-delivery-6bcc4/authentication/settings

Add these domains:
```
oil-delivery-tracking-app.asif1001.repl.co
replit.app
*.replit.app
localhost
127.0.0.1
```

### Step 3: Test Authentication
After adding domains:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for propagation
2. Test login with: asif1001@gmail.com or asif.s@ekkanoo.com.bh

## Alternative Solution:
If you can't access Firebase Console, I can temporarily modify the app to use a different authentication method or Firebase Auth Emulator for testing.

## Status:
- ðŸŸ¢ App Code: Working perfectly
- ðŸŸ¢ Replit Hosting: Ready
- ðŸ”´ Firebase Auth Domains: Need manual setup

The login will work immediately after adding the Replit domain to Firebase Console.
