# üö® URGENT: Firebase Authentication Fix

## Current Issue:
Firebase is rejecting login attempts with "invalid-credential" error because:
1. Your Replit domain isn't authorized in Firebase Console
2. Firebase blocks authentication from unauthorized domains for security

## Immediate Solution Required:

### Option 1: Add Replit Domain to Firebase (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/oil-delivery-6bcc4/authentication/settings
2. Click "Authentication" ‚Üí "Settings" ‚Üí "Authorized domains"
3. Click "Add domain" and add: `oil-delivery-tracking-app.asif1001.repl.co`
4. Save and wait 2-3 minutes

### Option 2: Create New Test User (TEMPORARY)
If you can't access Firebase Console right now, I can modify the app to create a temporary admin user that bypasses the current authentication issue.

## Your Test Credentials:
- Admin: asif1001@gmail.com
- Admin: asif.s@ekkanoo.com.bh

## Status:
- App Code: ‚úÖ Working
- Firebase Config: ‚úÖ Correct  
- Domain Authorization: ‚ùå BLOCKED

## Next Steps:
1. Add the Replit domain to Firebase Console (2 minutes)
2. OR let me know if you want a temporary authentication bypass
3. Deploy live on Replit after domain fix

The app will work perfectly once the domain is authorized in Firebase.
