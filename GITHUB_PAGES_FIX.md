# ‚úÖ GitHub Pages Routing Issue FIXED

## Problem Solved:
- ‚ùå Login redirected to `https://asif1001.github.io/` (wrong!)
- ‚ùå Logout redirected to `https://asif1001.github.io/` (wrong!)

## Solution Applied:
- ‚úÖ Login now stays within app: `https://asif1001.github.io/oil-delivery-app/`
- ‚úÖ Logout now stays within app: `https://asif1001.github.io/oil-delivery-app/`

## Changes Made:
1. **Fixed login redirect**: Now reloads within the app path
2. **Fixed logout redirect**: Now reloads within the app path  
3. **Updated routing logic**: Prevents escaping to root domain

## Version Update:
- App version: **v1.3.1**
- Deployment: **Complete**

## Test Your App Now:
1. Visit: https://asif1001.github.io/oil-delivery-app
2. Login with driver credentials
3. Should stay within `/oil-delivery-app/` path
4. Logout should also stay within app path

## Status: 
üü¢ **RESOLVED** - Routing now works correctly on GitHub Pages

The app will no longer redirect to the wrong domain during login/logout!
